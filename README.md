# Assignments

## Students

We're using GitHub Classroom, which basically means you do all your work in a pre-prepared GitHub repository.

You will receive the Github Link for each assignment. Once you accept the assignment, you will be directed to a GitHub Repo, where you can see the assignment Instructions and what you need to execute.
 
There are different ways to complete your assignment. 1) You can edit the appropriate code directly in to the repo using edit tab. 2) you can clone the repo, work on your code and push your updated code to the repo. 

There are videos who can help you to follow step by step approach for both the above-mentioned approach. I have attached the below YouTube video link which performs approach 2.
