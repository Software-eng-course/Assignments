## Students

We're using GitHub Classroom, which basically means you do all your work in a pre-prepared GitHub repository.

You can accept your first assignment via following link:
https://classroom.github.com/a/uRGHu2qb

Once you accept the assignment, you will be directed to a GitHub Repo, where you can see the assignment Instructions and what you need to execute.
 

Let me know if you have any questions.
